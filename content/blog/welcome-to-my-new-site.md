It's taken me a while to get around to this, but I've finally rebuilt my website after a significant hiatus. I've built this site using Hugo instead of WordPress. This brings a lot of benefits, but primarily, I can focus less on security and compatibility while enjoying the lightning-fast speed of a static site generator. Plus, the entire site, plus the underlying builds, are hosted entirely on GitHub.

Stay tuned to this website as I showcase current projects I'm working on!
